### 📈 Portfolio Project: Restaurant Sales Analysis

Here is a case study from a recent project where I analyzed restaurant sales data to uncover key performance metrics and trends.

#### **Project Overview**
The objective was to analyze a restaurant company's sales data from an Excel file to extract actionable insights. The project involved a full data analysis workflow, from cleaning and preprocessing to exploratory analysis and visualization.

#### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
The initial dataset required significant cleaning to prepare it for analysis:
* **Handled Unstructured Data:** Promoted the first data row to serve as the DataFrame's column headers.
* **Data Transformation:** Converted `Quantity`, `Order ID`, and `Price` columns to their proper numeric types. The `Date` column was converted to a datetime object.
* **Data Standardization:** Cleaned the `Manager` column by stripping extraneous whitespace, reducing the unique manager count from 14 to an accurate 5.
* **Duplicate Removal:** Identified and removed duplicate order entries to ensure data integrity.

#### **2. Key Findings & Visualizations**

**Finding 1: Credit Cards are the Preferred Payment Method**
Credit Card transactions accounted for nearly half (47%) of all sales, making it the most dominant payment method.

**Finding 2: Burgers Drive Revenue, Beverages Drive Volume**
While **Beverages** were the highest-selling product category by quantity, **Burgers** generated the most revenue, highlighting their importance as a high-value item.

**Finding 3: Top Performance**
The analysis identified **Lisbon**, managed by **Joao Silva**, as the city and manager generating the highest revenue.

#### **Conclusion & Impact**
This analysis provided clear, data-driven insights that can directly inform business strategy. Recommendations include launching marketing campaigns to boost Gift Card usage and optimizing inventory for high-revenue (Burgers) and high-volume (Beverages) products. This project showcases my end-to-end ability to turn messy data into a valuable strategic asset.
